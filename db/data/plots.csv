Around 14 years ago there was serial killer on the loose in Ellarion city. Or killer duo as it later on turned out. The killer became known as the chain strangler due the methods they used. All the victims were strangled and the chain was left wrapped around their necks. The case was on your deck over two years and you spent countless nights going through the evidence and picking up clues. Your teams extensive background search led you to Osiris where there had been similar murders few years back. And they led to you on the tracks of Koga Kyoshi and Yahir Watts. Over two years after the first murder on Ellarion you finally catched them. Arrest didn’t go as smoothly as planned and resulted on you shooting one of the suspects as they tried to strangle one of your men as last desperate act. Koga Kyoshi was however captured. But they never saw the trial. After extensive interrogations and psychic evaluations it was decided somewhere far above your paygrade that Koga would become a part of an experiment. Instead of going to jail, their memories would be completely erased and they would assume a new identity essentially becoming a new person. There was nothing you could do and so after many preparations a person responsible for the death of dozens of people walked to freedom as Torrey Antolini.   

Briana Chambers

Further, one particular case you remember well was a prisoner you met at the end of  your first round of studies, when doing an intern for criminal psychology a little bit over 10 years ago. They had submitted themself to a government experiment, where the prisoner was granted their freedom, provided that they let their memories be destroyed from their mind. The discussion stuck with you. The prisoner was Koga Kyoshi, the person known as a chain strangler, they had along with their partner terrorised Ellarion city for over two years. Their partner Yahir Watts had died during the arrest and Koga was absolutely devastated over it. It was peculiar to see how a person who was so callous and cruel to their victims had loved their partner so deeply. Koga was a broken person, born in poverty in Osiris and grown twisted in an environment where no one should need to live. That case haunted you for years since your internship ended before you got to know how it ended and when you tried to follow up on the case later, you found yourself on a wild goose chase. Nobody seemed to know anything about anything even like the case or so they wanted you to believe, maybe it was yet another project of the government buried after a while. You are sure, though, that you do not misremember the case, and also that the prisoner really might live amongst you with a new identity."
2,The secret sibling of Amir Bolton - Jill Montoya,,"20077, 20000, 20044",28,,Small,Lost Relative,Should have,Text NPC,TRUE,4,FALSE,Mark Bolton is the real father of Jill Montoya.

Later on Mark made sure that Jill was hired on ESS Odysseus under his other child Amir Bolton.,"Mark (father) and Amir Bolton had a different idea how Amir should progress in their career. Mark wanted Amir to be a Star captain like he was. Amir didn't.
Mark should reveal that they are the father of Jill Montoya only after he is cast out from ESS Harbinger (mutiny Event).","Amir Bolton

Mark, your father and Commander, Star Captain of the ESS Harbinger, wanted you to follow in his footsteps and become a Star Captain but when he found out you had quit your Marine training to be an Engineer, he cut all communications with you. Your mother, Liz, tried to reason with him but in the end it only caused your parents to file for divorce. You are still unsure whether you should try to write your father one more letter. He did seem to be more receptive after Amie’s funeral."

Amir Bolton had a crush on Cherry back in the day and named ESS Odysseus after Cherry.","This is the story how Odysseus got a nick name Cherry.
Serafina Banner aka Cherry is reborn Tristan Fukui.","Amir Bolton

Karin was the greatest wingman of them all. You fell in love with a pilot with a call sign “Cherry”. You never actually met the person, but you saw them performing moves you couldn’t even imagine. There wasn’t anyone who could get everything out of a fighter like Cherry did. It was like the wings were attached to their own shoulders.  Cherry wasn’t flying the fighter, they were the fighter. There was even an evasive manoeuvre named after Cherry: Cherry’s Barrel. You weren’t sure if you admired the person or their actions more. The raw power and the smooth handling of the machine just blew you away. It was weirdly natural for you to feel attraction towards something like that.
Karin was there telling you jokingly that you were crazy. It would never work out, that your “Cherry” was somewhere else. Immediately you thought of Odysseus… "
