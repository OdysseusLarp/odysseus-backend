Around 14 years ago there was serial killer on the loose in Ellarion city. Or killer duo as it later on turned out. The killer became known as the chain strangler due the methods they used. All the victims were strangled and the chain was left wrapped around their necks. The case was on your deck over two years and you spent countless nights going through the evidence and picking up clues. Your teams extensive background search led you to Osiris where there had been similar murders few years back. And they led to you on the tracks of Koga Kyoshi and Yahir Watts. Over two years after the first murder on Ellarion you finally catched them. Arrest didn’t go as smoothly as planned and resulted on you shooting one of the suspects as they tried to strangle one of your men as last desperate act. Koga Kyoshi was however captured. But they never saw the trial. After extensive interrogations and psychic evaluations it was decided somewhere far above your paygrade that Koga would become a part of an experiment. Instead of going to jail, their memories would be completely erased and they would assume a new identity essentially becoming a new person. There was nothing you could do and so after many preparations a person responsible for the death of dozens of people walked to freedom as Torrey Antolini.

Further, one particular case you remember well was a prisoner you met at the end of  your first round of studies, when doing an intern for criminal psychology a little bit over 10 years ago. They had submitted themself to a government experiment, where the prisoner was granted their freedom, provided that they let their memories be destroyed from their mind. The discussion stuck with you. The prisoner was Koga Kyoshi, the person known as a chain strangler, they had along with their partner terrorised Ellarion city for over two years. Their partner Yahir Watts had died during the arrest and Koga was absolutely devastated over it. It was peculiar to see how a person who was so callous and cruel to their victims had loved their partner so deeply. Koga was a broken person, born in poverty in Osiris and grown twisted in an environment where no one should need to live. That case haunted you for years since your internship ended before you got to know how it ended and when you tried to follow up on the case later, you found yourself on a wild goose chase. Nobody seemed to know anything about anything even like the case or so they wanted you to believe, maybe it was yet another project of the government buried after a while. You are sure, though, that you do not misremember the case, and also that the prisoner really might live amongst you with a new identity."

Mark Bolton had a short affair with Qwen Montoya and result was Jill Montoya. Mark knew but didn't want to break his marrige for Qwen and Jill. Qwen found some scavanger man to be with (and they pretend to be the other parent for Jill). After few baby years Qwen and the scavanger man pretty much left Jill to survive alone. Life was too hard for them. From the shadows Mark (with the help of Lera Yang) helped Jill survive and got a spot from military for Jill. Later on Mark made sure that Jill was hired on ESS Odysseus under his other child Amir Bolton.,"Mark (father) and Amir Bolton had a different idea how Amir should progress in their career. Mark wanted Amir to be a Star captain like he was. Amir didn't.
Mark should reveal that they are the father of Jill Montoya only after he is cast out from ESS Harbinger (mutiny Event).

Mark Bolton is the real father of Jill Montoya. Mark Bolton had a short affair with Qwen Montoya and result was Jill Montoya. Mark knew but didn't want to break his marriage for Qwen and Jill. Qwen found some scavenger man to be with (and they pretend to be the other parent for Jill). After few baby years Qwen and the scavanger man pretty much left Jill to survive alone. Life was too hard for them. From the shadows Mark (with the help of Lera Yang) helped Jill to survive and got a spot from military for Jill. Mark made sure that Jill was getting the military engineering training, a transfer to Ellarion City Military Academy. Mark was supprised when Leigh Kent (a young Purity politician) pulled some strings so that Jill could be hired on ESS Odysseus but Jill didn't accept the job that someone else had ""given"" them. Jill got an internship on OSS Taurus and pretty soon was promoted to ESS Bluecoat. Mark was proud of Jill and how relentlessly they fought their way in the society. Unlike Amir who had all within their grasp and they didn't want to pursue to be a Star Captain (as was their dream as a child). Amir would have made a great Captain and now Amir would never rise to their fathers level. After Jill's promotions it was easier for Mark to pull some strings behind the scenes and get Jill a promotion to ESS Odysseus under their other child Amir Bolton. At least they both were now in the same place and easier to keep an eye on them. Jill definitely had more ambitions and with a right push... maybe Jill could be the next Star Captain of the family?","Amir Bolton

Mark, your father and Commander, Star Captain of the ESS Harbinger, wanted you to follow in his footsteps and become a Star Captain but when he found out you had quit your Marine training to be an Engineer, he cut all communications with you. Your mother, Liz, tried to reason with him but in the end it only caused your parents to file for divorce. You are still unsure whether you should try to write your father one more letter. He did seem to be more receptive after Amie’s funeral."

Karin was the greatest wingman of them all. You fell in love with a pilot with a call sign “Cherry”. You never actually met the person, but you saw them performing moves you couldn’t even imagine. There wasn’t anyone who could get everything out of a fighter like Cherry did. It was like the wings were attached to their own shoulders.  Cherry wasn’t flying the fighter, they were the fighter. There was even an evasive manoeuvre named after Cherry: Cherry’s Barrel. You weren’t sure if you admired the person or their actions more. The raw power and the smooth handling of the machine just blew you away. It was weirdly natural for you to feel attraction towards something like that.
Karin was there telling you jokingly that you were crazy. It would never work out, that your “Cherry” was somewhere else. Immediately you thought of Odysseus… "

5,Engineers steals alien artifact from scientists,"Scientists, Engineers, Security","20001, 20074, 20010",,EL-QV57-5,Medium,"Alien, Artifacts, Improvements to Odysseus",Nice to have,Text NPC,TRUE,3,FALSE,"Engineers notices that on of the alien artifacts reacts to Vane Hodges blood and steals the artifact for further research.

- USB stick puzzle for scientists to figure out frequency values","Vane Hodge

Two days ago you were with Nikita in the science lab fixing some conductors under the table when you managed to cut a rather deep wound on your hand. Cursing under your breath, you leaned against the table for support, only to realize too late that your blood had tainted the surface of an alien artifact retrieved from the planet's surface. Hastily wiping away the traces of blood with your sleeve, you couldn't help but notice a strange reaction in the behavior of the artifact. 

You and Nikita quickly realized that your blood had triggered the response in the artifact. You  exchanged a startled glance before swiftly inserting the artifact into your tool bag. The gut feeling told you both that this was something you really wanted to investigate further. You were sure that the artifact had more to do with engineering and ship than science. They would never figure out what the artifact could really do, you were sure of it. With a sense of urgency, you made your way to the medbay, your mind buzzing with questions and possibilities surrounding the mysterious artifact.

When you got out of the medbay, you and Nikita hid the artifact to investigate it more closely.  Your research indicated that the artifact was some sort of power regulator which could stabilize and optimize energy flows by manipulating the quantum states of the frequency modulator. You were quite sure that if you made a few tweaks and changes to it, you could transform it to help with the ship's calibrations. In a best scenario it could add one calibration slot. It would be hard work and first you had to let EVA, the ship’s AI, conduct some calculations regarding the safety of the ship if it would be integrated into the Odysseus. Now you are just waiting for the results from EVA and trying to keep the item secret. So far there has been no news about the missing artifact."
