Around 14 years ago there was serial killer on the loose in Ellarion city. Or killer duo as it later on turned out. The killer became known as the chain strangler due the methods they used. All the victims were strangled and the chain was left wrapped around their necks. The case was on your deck over two years and you spent countless nights going through the evidence and picking up clues. Your teams extensive background search led you to Osiris where there had been similar murders few years back. And they led to you on the tracks of Koga Kyoshi and Yahir Watts. Over two years after the first murder on Ellarion you finally catched them. Arrest didn’t go as smoothly as planned and resulted on you shooting one of the suspects as they tried to strangle one of your men as last desperate act. Koga Kyoshi was however captured. But they never saw the trial. After extensive interrogations and psychic evaluations it was decided somewhere far above your paygrade that Koga would become a part of an experiment. Instead of going to jail, their memories would be completely erased and they would assume a new identity essentially becoming a new person. There was nothing you could do and so after many preparations a person responsible for the death of dozens of people walked to freedom as Torrey Antolini. 
Briana Chambers
Further, one particular case you remember well was a prisoner you met at the end of  your first round of studies, when doing an intern for criminal psychology a little bit over 10 years ago. They had submitted themself to a government experiment, where the prisoner was granted their freedom, provided that they let their memories be destroyed from their mind. The discussion stuck with you. The prisoner was Koga Kyoshi, the person known as a chain strangler, they had along with their partner terrorised Ellarion city for over two years. Their partner Yahir Watts had died during the arrest and Koga was absolutely devastated over it. It was peculiar to see how a person who was so callous and cruel to their victims had loved their partner so deeply. Koga was a broken person, born in poverty in Osiris and grown twisted in an environment where no one should need to live. That case haunted you for years since your internship ended before you got to know how it ended and when you tried to follow up on the case later, you found yourself on a wild goose chase. Nobody seemed to know anything about anything even like the case or so they wanted you to believe, maybe it was yet another project of the government buried after a while. You are sure, though, that you do not misremember the case, and also that the prisoner really might live amongst you with a new identity."
2,The secret sibling of Amir Bolton - Jill Montoya,,"Amir Bolton, Mark Bolton, Qwen Montoya, Jill Montoya, Lera Yang",55,,Small,Lost relative,Should have,Text NPC,TRUE,14,FALSE,"Mark Bolton is the real father of Jill Montoya. 
Mark Bolton had a short affair with Qwen Montoya and result was Jill Montoya. Mark knew but didn't want to break his marrige for Qwen and Jill. Qwen found some scavanger man to be with (and they pretend to be the other parent for Jill). After few baby years Qwen and the scavanger man pretty much left Jill to survive alone. Life was too hard with a toddler. From the shadows Mark (with the help of Lera Yang) helped Jill survive and got a spot from military for them. Later on Mark made sure that Jill was hired on ESS Odysseus under his other child Amir Bolton.
Mark made sure that Jill was getting the military engineering training, a transfer to Ellarion City Military Academy. Mark was supprised when Leigh Kent (a young Purity politician) pulled some strings so that Jill could be hired on ESS Odysseus but Jill didn't accept the job that someone else had ""given"" them. Jill got an internship on OSS Taurus and pretty soon was promoted to ESS Bluecoat. Mark was proud of Jill and how relentlessly they fought their way in the society. Unlike Amir who had all within their grasp and they didn't want to pursue to be a Star Captain (as was their dream as a child). Amir would have made a great Captain and now Amir would never rise to their fathers level. After Jill's promotions it was easier for Mark to pull some strings behind the scenes and get Jill a promotion to ESS Odysseus under their other child Amir Bolton. At least they both were now in the same place and easier to keep an eye on them. Jill definitely had more ambitions and with a right push... maybe Jill could be the next Star Captain of the family?",Mark should reveal that they are the father of Jill Montoya only after he is cast out from ESS Harbinger (mutiny Event).,

Karin was the greatest wingman of them all. You fell in love with a pilot with a call sign “Cherry”. You never actually met the person, but you saw them performing moves you couldn’t even imagine. There wasn’t anyone who could get everything out of a fighter like Cherry did. It was like the wings were attached to their own shoulders.  Cherry wasn’t flying the fighter, they were the fighter. There was even an evasive manoeuvre named after Cherry: Cherry’s Barrel. You weren’t sure if you admired the person or their actions more. The raw power and the smooth handling of the machine just blew you away. It was weirdly natural for you to feel attraction towards something like that.
Karin was there telling you jokingly that you were crazy. It would never work out, that your “Cherry” was somewhere else. Immediately you thought of Odysseus… "

Two days ago you were with Nikita in the science lab fixing some conductors under the table when you managed to cut a rather deep wound on your hand. Cursing under your breath, you leaned against the table for support, only to realize too late that your blood had tainted the surface of an alien artifact retrieved from the planet's surface. Hastily wiping away the traces of blood with your sleeve, you couldn't help but notice a strange reaction in the behavior of the artifact. 
You and Nikita quickly realized that your blood had triggered the response in the artifact. You  exchanged a startled glance before swiftly inserting the artifact into your tool bag. The gut feeling told you both that this was something you really wanted to investigate further. You were sure that the artifact had more to do with engineering and ship than science. They would never figure out what the artifact could really do, you were sure of it. With a sense of urgency, you made your way to the medbay, your mind buzzing with questions and possibilities surrounding the mysterious artifact.
When you got out of the medbay, you and Nikita hid the artifact to investigate it more closely.  Your research indicated that the artifact was some sort of power regulator which could stabilize and optimize energy flows by manipulating the quantum states of the frequency modulator. You were quite sure that if you made a few tweaks and changes to it, you could transform it to help with the ship's calibrations. In a best scenario it could add one calibration slot. It would be hard work and first you had to let EVA, the ship’s AI, conduct some calculations regarding the safety of the ship if it would be integrated into the Odysseus. Now you are just waiting for the results from EVA and trying to keep the item secret. So far there has been no news about the missing artifact."

Being public android during the war against machines",Brief player with following information:,"Evin Reid
Project Ziva
In 529 you started a new project: building a fully human-like android of your own, Ziva Callahan. Project Devyn was still ongoing, but the reprogramming itself was practically complete. You were mainly tinkering with the final details of its fabricated personal history while waiting for the permission to set it free. You finally had time for the challenge you had been waiting to tackle most of your life.
By this time, creating a human-like body was no longer an insurmountable obstacle, thanks to Devyn and some of the Machine-made parts you had found with it. You delegated most of that work to your team and concentrated on a more intriguing problem: the mind. 
Building on Yera’s previous work, you came to believe that creating a more realistic personality required integrating real memories into artificial ones. It was clear to you that the crucial core memories were those from childhood. They needed to be collected from children to preserve their authenticity and clarity. The morality of doing this became a recurring topic in your increasingly common and vicious fights with Yera. In their opinion, memories were the core of who we are as a person. Children, not being mature enough to consider all the implications, could not consent to their memories being used. For you, this was a non-issue, since the memories could be modified enough that the final AI should not be able to recognize their source. But Yera wouldn’t budge.
When it rains, it pours. The threads of your happy life unraveled one at a time. Not long after the divorce, Haven started getting ill. The diagnosis was leukemia, a high-risk type that gave them little time to live. Why hadn’t you spent more time with your child when you still had the chance? Watching Haven deteriorate was the hardest thing you had ever had to face. Yera was there all through it. You tried your best to support each other, but couldn’t really find comfort in each other anymore. The only solace you had, after Haven died in 532, was that during the weeks your child had spent with you – and had still been well – you had managed to collect and preserve many of their memories. In your grief, you were oddly comforted to think that a part of Haven would live on in the AI you were working on for your android, Ziva. You did not tell Yera of what you had done.
Brief: Project Ziva
These are your child’s happy memories which you have incorporated to be a part of Ziva’s personality.  
“Higher, higher!” you scream, and the swing takes you ever upward. You can feel the wind in your hair and the touch of your parent’s hands on your back as they push to give you more speed. The pure joy of feeling free and being safe. You can hear your other parent laughing from where they are sitting on a picnic blanket. “Come on you two, let’s eat!” As the swaying stops, you feel your parent lifting you up from the swing and hugging you. “Come, little one, let’s race to the food.”
You hold the hand tight. The animals at the zoo are scary. “It’s OK love,” the soft voice of your parent says. “I’m here for you. It’s all safe.”
“I want the big one!” You point at the huge lollipop on the shelf in a large candy store. You look pleadingly at your parent. Their smile becomes softer as they nod at the lady at the counter. “The big one, please.”
You are lying in bed between your parents. They hold a big book full of colorful pictures. You know they are telling the story wrong, but it is so funny you just keep bursting into laughter when you try to tell them to read the story as it is written. 
And these are chapters from Ziva’s character about your shared past:
Let’s face it, you are not human. You never have been nor will you ever be one. You were created by humans. No matter how hard you try, you will always be a machine and thus an enemy to some of them. You are ageless, if treated well you could basically live forever. Eternal life is something people have been dreaming about for as long as they have been part of this universe. The ones who created you gave you loads of memories, but they are not yours. You are 5 years 3 months 6 days 8 hours 3 minutes and 12 seconds old. At leas, that is how long it has been since your memory drive was last erased. There have probably been previous versions of you, tests, calibrations, trials done and errors made until they created what you are now. You wonder what the previous “you”s were like. 
First you were shown off to everyone as… well, a toy. You didn’t feel good about that, but you wanted to make your creator happy, as most children do. Everyone wanted to know if you could do this or that or that… You are more than just some test device. Evin had been by your side all along, and then they just... weren’t. After two years of showcasing you in all sorts of science conferences and events, Evin came to you one night and looked at you for a long time. When they left again, there was a single tear in their eye. Evin didn’t say anything, but you felt this was the final goodbye. You never saw them again."

Rumors have been swirling, but the exact cause of the quarrel remains a mystery.
Some believe it all began innocently enough with a well-intentioned prank orchestrated by Amir to lighten the mood amidst the tension on board. However, Isha, the Quartermaster, failed to see the humor in it and retaliated by taking away the engineering crew's beloved break room, which was the Old Chief Engineer’s room,  transforming it into a hydroponic garden. While the transformation of the storage room into a science lab seemed reasonable, the loss of the break room was baffling. It was undoubtedly an act of revenge since Isha knew the sentimental value of the room to you. Who even utilizes the hydroponic garden?
Your protests fell on deaf ears, like fairy wings fluttering against the steel hull of a starship. Amir tried to reason with Isha how in the break room were very delicate antimatter phase transistors which were sensitive to moisture but nothing could be done. Isha had gotten some others on the ship to back it up and so you had to construct a special casing to shield your fragile systems from moisture.
And to add insult to injury, Isha had a bit of an allergic reaction to hazelnuts after indulging in Amir's peace-offering cake. Thankfully, someone helped them off to sickbay before things got too dicey. Now, Isha's convinced that Amir's out for revenge, which couldn't be further from the truth. You all know Amir wouldn't harm a fly, let alone orchestrate a sneaky plot against someone.
Regardless of how it started, tension between Amir and Isha has reached a boiling point, with the engineering and armory crews caught in the middle. Amir is determined to reclaim the break room, while Isha remains steadfast in their decision, convinced of Amir's ill intentions. Who knew a simple act of kindness could spiral into such chaos?

At that moment, someone came up to you. “If you could just state your names… we are trying to keep track of the survivors”, they said, holding some papers. Terror crept up your back and you felt the panic inside you rise; you had not thought of any escape route, alibi or identity, how could you have? And you could absolutely not give them your own name, no; the attacks were your possibility of disappearing, not being the spoiled heir of the Purity dynasty you had seeked to destroy. Suddenly, your fling got you out of the trouble; they introduced you two as Ator and Jona Davis, the famous (but elusive) artist couple. “THE Davis couple? The painter and the writer?” the person with the paper exclaimed. “Yes. If you don’t mind, I would like to have some time with my partner”, your fling, ‘Jona’, said coolly, looking at you.

The following is a summary of the relevant information your character has learned from and about Gallan. We suggest going through this information with Gallan’s player, to make sure you are on the same page regarding what your character knows. You can also ask Gallan’s player to share more information beforehand, either as meta or ingame information, if it feels like knowing more would make your game better.
Gallan’s android body is similar to Devyn’s: almost indistinguishable from real human bodies, hard but not impossible to destroy, self-healing etc. All the information in the brief about androids holds true for Gallan. What you have learned by studying them only confirms your earlier findings.
Gallan’s mind seems to have a human origin and is somehow connected to the Genesis ships which centuries ago brought humans to the Arati system.
Gallan remembers being a human scientist onboard one of these ships.
Gallan remembers having a family: mother, father, older sister. Sadness is connected to these memories, but they do not remember why.
The Genesis ship Gallan lived on was searching for the source of a signal they had first received generations ago. The ship separated from the rest of the fleet and, for reasons Gallan cannot quite explain, released a virus which corrupted the databases of the other ships. Gallan remembers they found the source of the signal, but cannot remember what they found there.
Something is blocking your access to parts of Gallan’s consciousness. You can see their memory holds more information than what currently manifests as the personality calling itself Gallan.
You have not shared this observation with Gallan, but there is also something that looks like a damaged communication protocol. Most likely it was damaged by your students’ attempts to restore Gallan.
When Gallan first woke up, they mentioned the word ‘Nest’ and expressed a need to get back somewhere. Later they have not been able to explain what they meant.
You have a theory that the ‘Nest’ has something to do with the Machines, that it might be a space station, starship or a planet. Gallan has neither confirmed nor denied this hypothesis."

Purple Party had a row who would be the next Party Leader and they decided that whom ever gets more votes on Senator elections would be the next party leader. The opponent was Yuri Mills.
Leigh Kent believes that the Senator post would have been rightfully theirs since they lost only by a little especially if the rumors are true that the election was rigged. Tampering the votes didn't have anything to do with Leigh losing in the elections.",,"Kai Rogers
Several months before the elections, the Purple party was in a volatile position because the previous party leader had announced that they were not going to run again, and would quit the senate after these elections. There was a power vacuum in the party, and both our moderate wing and the radical wing were desperate to fill it: whoever became the new party leader would have a huge impact on the direction the party would take in the next few years. After months of campaigning and negotiating, two candidates, senators Richard Tremor (NPC) from the moderate end of the party and Yuri Mills from the radical one, were running neck and neck and neither side wanted to give in to the other. Finally, three months ago, the party decided that it would not be a good look if we can’t even choose a leader. We finally came to the agreement that whomever, Tremor or Mills, would get more votes in the elections would get the party leader position. It might even benefit our party if the voters felt they could participate in a battle of two great leaders.
Both wings were polling the votes regularly, and we in the moderate wing did not like how the situation was developing. We heard that behind the scenes the radical wing was running a smear campaign on Tremor, spreading rumors and blatant lies about him. And that was probably only the tip of the iceberg as they were surely using all means necessary to secure a win. Tremor was popular too: he was a legend, long term senator and a decent human being who wasn’t afraid to stand against Purity, his own Dynasty, when it was necessary. But it looked like Mills would win by a close margin. Mills was the puppet of the most radical members of the party, and Kai was very worried what they would do when grasping the power over the party.
As the elections came closer and it seemed Mills would definitely win over Tremor, we had to act. Gordon recruited a hacker, Kai pulled together the funding, and a small but significant number of final votes were soon registered in support of Tremor instead of Mills. 
So it was done: Tremor secured the party leader positions, and Mills was left as a runner-up."

Attackers were never found, but criminal organization Zodiac Web was investigated as being behind the attack. 
Remi Sharp's most recent kill was a year ago during a mission to hack the Osiris Embassy on Ellarion for the Zodiac Web. The mission required them to physically plant a hacking device inside the embassy. Everything went as planned until they were interrupted by Kira Steele, the Consul General’s Assistant, whom they shot and killed. Though they completed the mission, Remi was haunted by guilt and anxiety, especially as news reports emerged about Kira’s mysterious death. Their carelessness left behind fingerprints, linking the attack to the Zodiac Web.
When Lane Thomas heard Shae Thomas (who ran away) might be on the space station Atlantis 3, Lane applied for a job there. To get the paperwork done, Lane paid the Zodiac Web for help. Later they realized their papers and passage to Atlantis had caused someone to die and feel bad about it (it was the attack to Osiris Embassy).",,"Remi Sharp
You have killed a few people over the years which never got easier. Each time you had difficulties dealing with what you had done. Somehow taking a life always felt totally absurd. Yet you were ready to do anything for your father – even murder. The last time you killed someone was about a year ago. You still remember it as clear as day. You were on a mission to hack the databases of the Osiris Embassy on Ellarion to get visas for some customers of the Zodiac Web. The tricky part was you had to break into the building and insert a hacking device on-site. The embassy’s firewalls were too strong to do it remotely. 
Everything went smoothly until you were in the office downloading a visa for someone called Lane Thomas when the door opened and someone walked in. For a brief moment you both hesitated, but then you took your gun and shot the woman. One of the bullets pierced her heart and she died immediately. You then quickly finished downloading the files and fled the scene. The mission was a success but you felt extremely bad every time you saw the news reports about the mysterious death of Kira Steele (NPC), the Consul General’s Assistant. You felt confused and anxious about it. You couldn’t help but think about how the victim’s family and friends must have felt. To make it worse, you had not been careful enough and the police managed to find some fingerprints that tied the attack to the Zodiac Web."

This new hit was supposed to be a clean job - a swift kill with no witnesses. Black hoodie, black tank top, nothing suspicious - you should be one in a million walking down the streets. The victim, Misha Kent, was a senator who chose to go against his Dynasty’s wishes and join the Yellow Party, making a lot of very important people very displeased. You’re not sure why you were told the reasons this time. You asked and maybe they told you by mistake or they thought you would do a better job if it was “justified”. You’re not sure if it was better to know the reasons since you couldn’t affect the outcome either way. 

Perhaps it was bad luck, perhaps you were still reeling after the murder of Ismy’s mother, but you made a mistake during the hit. The hit was successful, the victim died and you made it look like a robbery, but it was not as clean as you would have liked - and apparently there was a witness. You were scolded for leaving the witness alive, and you were ashamed to admit that you hadn’t even noticed anyone. Luckily, the witness didn’t identify you, or maybe they decided not to rat you out - and you were off the hook. You never found out who that was, but sometimes it makes you wonder. Why didn’t they testify?

Gene Hawkins
11 years ago, when on a visit to Ellarion, you witnessed a man being murdered, stabbed, in cold blood. The only thing you saw of the assassin was a characteristic mark on their skin; not enough to identify them, but enough for you to remember the mark to this day. The mark was an X shaped scar between shoulder and collarbone. They were wearing a black tank top under a black hoodie and you saw a glimpse of that scar. You can still sometimes see it in your eyes if you close them and think about what had happened. Unfortunately, since you were the only other person at the scene, you were arrested on suspicion of murder. As it turned out, the dead man was an incredibly important figure - a senator by the name of Misha Kent. That meant that finding the killer was of paramount importance, and since you were the only one at the scene, the police tried to pin the murder on you. 
Those days in captivity were some of the worst in your entire life. The police tried to extort a confession out of you with threats, humiliation and violence. They reminded you that you were a nobody, a lowlife from Osiris with no dynasty and no social standing. You didn’t confess, of course - you weren’t a bloody killer! They tormented you until someone decided it was enough, and they finally let you go on account of there being no evidence of your involvement. "

As one of the people behind Devyn’s artificial memories, your character of course knows what they contain. The following is what is written in Devyn’s character as a summary of their life up to the point when they were released and their real memories begin. If Devyn’s player (who, depending on the run, might not know beforehand that their character is a Machine) has invented more old memories, we suggest you treat them as if these memories were also programmed by you.

If your early life had to be summed up in one word, that word would be ‘balanced.’ You grew up as the only child of a completely ordinary family in one of the numerous middle class suburbs of Ellarion City. You were cherished and encouraged but not pampered, taught to value effort and perseverance over assumed talent. There was no doubt that you were talented. For as long as you can remember, you have known yourself to be considerably more intelligent than most people around you. 

Still, you remember having good friends as a child. You remember doing silly science experiments with them, celebrating birthdays and having sleepovers. You think you had a fairly normal adolescence, filled with school, parties, early fumbling relationships, the sort of ups and downs everyone experiences.

You avoided military service by enrolling in Ellarion City University a year early, in 519. You remember being told that your brains were far too valuable to be wasted on basic military training. At university you studied mechanical and natural sciences and pursued a wide variety of subjects from engineering to chemistry, which is why it took you a few years longer than average to graduate. In your memories, your student years all blur together into a seemingly endless string of days spent in libraries and laboratories, reading, writing, experimenting, experiencing frustration and triumphs. You had friends then too, but gradually you drifted apart and lost contact.

In 524 you experienced a personal tragedy when both of your parents unexpectedly died in a shuttle accident. Their shuttle was on its way from Ellarion to Caelena when it was hit by a tiny piece of space debris left on Ellarion’s orbit from the war that had ended only two years previously. You remember being sad but not devastated by the news. Things like this happened and it was only bad luck that happened to you. It wasn’t in your nature to blame anyone. You grieved and then moved on.

The biggest impact the accident had on your life was the way it affected your career choice. You became interested in spaceship technology and how accidents like this might be prevented. After graduation you worked for a few different companies, doing research and product development, but eventually, in 532, you returned to the university to devote your time to full-time research."

You looked at Glen pleadingly, knowing that his duty was to save you but hoping he would at least try to do something. He sighed and got out of the car. Your own vehicle was an armored, special car for imperial transports and you knew you were safe in there. If you didn’t open the doors, no one but Glen could get in.

The man who’d shouted for help was suddenly right behind Glen trying to hit him with something. Glen turned around quickly and soon he was lying on the ground. Glen turned back to the broken car and suddenly there was a gunshot. A woman escaped from the other side of the car and the man got up as well, running. After a while Glen came back and told you those people had tried to rob your car to be more safe themselves. He had taken their things and ID’s, and if you encountered others you might have to take up these identities for a while. Just to be safe. It was not safe to be of the Imperial family at the moment. You tried to get over your fear and guilt of making Glen go outside to face that situation in the first place. You didn’t want to make it harder and finally just nodded and started to study your new ID. You were Jordan Washington, a 30-year-old woman who looked like she was younger. She didn’t look very nice.

You are no monster
Eventually, Evin trusted you enough to let you out of your room on your own. That was a mistake. You cannot be trusted.

No, wait… you can be trusted, you can! What you did, you did for Evin. You wanted to protect them, to make sure nothing would come between them and their project. The other scientists were jealous of you and Evin. Jealous of how much more intelligent the two of you were; of how well you understood each other. They could never share what you shared and so they wanted to separate you from Evin, wanted to keep you locked up, restrained. They wanted to take you apart and find out all of your secrets. They even talked about how to shut you down again. You could not let that happen. You didn’t want to upset Evin, and you didn’t want to hurt anyone, not really, but you had to protect yourself if you wanted to protect Evin.

And the Nest. You could not risk these greedy, dangerous humans finding out about the Nest or its plans.

Their names were Alix Granville (NPC) and Kiran Norris (NPC). They had to die. It was unfortunate, but you could see no other way. So you made sure that is what happened. It was not difficult. You even tried to arrange it so that they didn’t suffer too much. You are no monster; you can show compassion even to those who wish to harm you. You made their deaths look like accidents so that Evin wouldn’t be too upset, though of course they were. You saw that later in their eyes. Perhaps you underestimated how important other people could be to Evin, even ones they didn’t like.

Granville died of carbon monoxide poisoning. It was child’s play to alter the filtering systems and safety alarms of one of the small greenhouses. You didn’t even need to lock Granville in. They were dead before they could reach the door. In hindsight, it would have been better if Norris had been there too. After Granville’s death, she became increasingly suspicious of you. You had to be more creative, so killing her took much longer than you would have liked. It was also much more traumatic to everyone involved than was ideal. 

But it couldn’t be helped. As long as she still existed there was the chance she might succeed in poisoning Evin’s mind against you. Poisoning, yes. You settled on radiation poisoning. You found out from the station’s logs that a wall section in one of the labs had been damaged in a recent meteor strike. You altered the maintenance schedule to make sure that Norris was working on the wall just when – how unfortunate – a powerful gamma ray burst from a nearby star struck the station. You defied Evin and took a calculated risk to get her to safety, but by that time you knew it was already too late. A few hours later she died, helped along by Evin and a heavy dose of sedatives Norris herself requested. It was not a pretty way to go, nor were the effects of radiation on your own body pleasant. But unlike humans, you could be repaired.

Evin never suspected you. You had tried to help, even risking your own life. Evin taught you how to repair your own body – it only required conscious effort, you learned – and made sure you knew it wasn’t your fault that Norris had died. Evin said that they were proud of you. It made you so happy to know that they didn’t hate you. You didn’t know what you would have done if they had. Now there was no longer any risk of anything bad happening because there was no one left to come between you.

You were all alone, just the two of you, and that was fine. That was perfect."

Just before the war ended Nolan was given a new marine team with one rookie member, Dani Hollow (NPC), who had graduated just months before. You were protecting one asteroid and important mining work, when somehow, somewhere an enemy had gotten on the surface knocking your air defense down. You were flanked, and in deep trouble. You were second in command to Nolan and  together you made a quick decision to move your positions. Unfortunately that got your team in a crossfire with a couple of other teams. Before the reinforcement came and drove the Machines away, Dani had been shot from behind. Whole mess had led to heavy casualties, and the Machines had been especially ferocious this time. You remember trying to help dying teammates make it until medics could reach you, Nolan holding someone’s guts with your hands while trying to convince them they could make it… You got wounded too, but refused any help and just kept fighting. It was a nightmare. You remember the faces of your marines, some dead, others dying. Still somehow the shot Dani took from behind haunted you the most. It bothered Nolan as well.

Of course that situation resulted in an official investigation: had Nolan and you made a mistake; was Dani shot by friendly fire. Those were cruciating weeks but finally you were deemed not guilty. The enemy just had managed to close on you from many advantage points and you hadn’t had any intel about one of those points. Still you know Nolan second guessed themself for a long time. You had known the terrain well and you should’ve calculated the possibility of that happening. Still it was an honest mistake, no one’s perfect, and many other teams made the same decision as you.

You tried not to panic (you were so not prepared for your own death, not on an emotional level, even though the army had taught you to think about dying rationally). You were surprised when you received a signal from them with a message. A robot-like voice speaking: if you surrender, they will not kill you. What the frak? Your survival instinct kicked in. A slim chance of survival was better than none? Maybe being imprisoned would be worth the chance, instead of being blown into pieces right there and then. 
Later, when you have thought about that moment when your whole life changed, you haven’t been sure if, in hindsight, you would have made the same choice. Maybe it would have been better for everyone if you had just died.
The Machines took you to a huge spaceship or a station, bigger than anything you’ve ever seen, where you were greeted by some of their robots, and then locked up in a room with walls covered with huge screens. You were expecting some interrogation, most likely some torture too, but not what you were about to experience. The first thing that blew your mind were the androids. First you thought they were other humans, but no, they told you point-blank that they were humanoid androids and that they would deal with you during your “stay”.
You spent something like a year there, never leaving that room. Their plan was never to manhandle you, although you did experience a lot of pain. Most of that was of the mental kind, though.
Some would describe the experience as being brainwashed. You don't see it in such a simplistic way. Your mind has been probed alright, you’re well aware of that. The androids forced you to listen, to watch, to feel. They would show you endless videos of all the crimes of humanity, and force you to talk about them, to think about them, to truly understand them. You had electrodes installed in your brain in order to excite certain areas there, to make their point come across clearly. The electrodes are long gone by now, but the message remains.
Humans don't have a divine-sent right to, well, anything. These planets and solar systems we inhabit are not ours. We think we are the height of civilization, where we actually are a backward species that has passed its peak, incapable of rising above our selfish struggles and petty skirmishes. Incapable of being organised, putting the whole before the one, developing into something better.
Make no mistake, You’re not thinking you are any better than any of the others. When you returned to the planet you used to call home, you were filled with not only contempt for all of humankind, but also self-loathing, and a sort of cool detachment from it all.
The Machines’ main point echoed clear in your mind: something has to be done. You as a species need a cleanse, a good shake-up, something that forces you out of your usual ways and unites you in the pursuit of a higher ground. Purpose. Leadership. A war. You had to prepare.
On coming back, you went through a long series of interrogations, led by Admiral Gaylen Russell, which was to be expected for a soldier who had been missing for as long as you had. In those talks, you tried to stick to the truth as far as possible: you told them how you had been caught, how the Machines had probed you physically and tried to manipulate you. You didn't have to fake being traumatised because you certainly had been shaken to your core. You didn't tell them about the androids because you feared they would suspect you could be an android as well, and you didn't want them to dig further into your thoughts than what was safe.
You don't think they believed everything you said, but you guess they believed just enough not to lock you up. Your supervisors were inclined to kick you out of the military, for lack of trust probably, but you agreed with them that you would resign, for mental health reasons. They did not want to make an example of you as it would be bad to the military's morale as the war was still so close behind and everyone feared a new attack might come anytime. Your capture was never a public knowledge, the army cooked up some story about you crashing to an asteroid and surviving with what you had on the ship and managing to repair your fighter to fly back.
You never saw any of your military colleagues again, except in passing on the street. They had probably been told to leave you alone. Your old friends were not your friends anymore. You didn’t reach out to them, they didn’t reach out to you. You became ghosts to each other. You told yourself it was fine, that it was easier when you didn’t have to hide from them how you were not the same person anymore. But it hurt then and it sort of hurts still. How the bonds that you thought are unbreakable crumble from the rot of time, the rot of humanity.
So you started your life over. You did go back to Cindi, at first, but your marriage only lasted for a few years after that, because your spouse realised you were a changed person and grew frustrated because you wouldn't let them in anymore. Cindi was completely right in that as well - your feelings and values and views were not the same anymore. You couldn’t love them like you once did.
You drifted away from the people you used to know, but that didn't mean you became a loner - you started connecting with other people, particularly the leaders of your dynasty. You had a new determination to change the world you lived in.
The leaders of the Purity Dynasty are mostly human scum, if you evaluate them objectively. They are power-hungry, ruthless people. This is why you despise them, but it is also why you chose them as your allies. You told them everything that had happened to you, if not how all that had changed you. You made plans together. First you have to build a new world order, then you can focus on making sure that the new order has proper leaders and values. You built up contacts, collected political currency, and stayed in the background, mostly. Pulled strings to make puppets dance. You were miserable, but you had energy for your work, fuelled by your burning hatred.
Cindi and you stayed friends. You met a few times a year. They moved on with their life, picked themself up. With time, you could forgive yourself for hurting them, because they were relatively happy for a while. Five years ago, they passed away. Cancer. You were at their funeral service, to pay your respects, but didn’t stay afterwards to talk with their family. None of your old friends, who used to be their friends too, were there.
In the end of the world, you find yourself missing the life you once had. The people in it, but most of all the person you yourself used to be."

The most difficult decision you ever had to make was 22 years ago. It was a secret mission to study an enemy vessel, a machine-build ship that had crashed on an asteroid. Your fleet was close, so you sent a group of soldiers to investigate. They found an android that looked exactly like a real human. They alerted the fleet and you gave the order to jump close by, bringing a scientist, one Evin Reid, with you. The operation to remove the humanlike android from the wreck was all but done, when suddenly the enemy jumped in the same sector. It was a huge fleet. You would have no chance to defeat it with the ships you had. Your orders, however, were crystal clear: bring the android to the EOC area - whatever the cost. You could have given the word to your fleet to jump and run, leaving the android where it was, saving thousands, but it would have broken the code you had followed for over twenty years. You knew what you had to do, but you just couldn’t make the words come out. You thought of all the soldiers in the ships around you and the seconds just flew by. Your sister, Shilah (NPC), was on one of those ships. Your friends were in them. The android could be a key to end this war - it could open so many doors to your researchers to understand these machines and their technology. You could never beat the Machines. Your bridge crew looked at you with desperation as you stood there, face like stone, seemingly calm. It seemed to last forever.
Finally you gave the order. The fleet was to protect your flagship, the fastest vessel in the fleet, until the android and everything in the wreck was on board. Then you would all try your best to escape. You could hear the solemnity in your officers' voices as they accepted your orders. Your head was spinning and you felt like you were drowning in the weight of your decision. You looked at the massacre that the Machines made around you as the android was being moved. It took too long, surely you would all die - but you didn’t. Finally the cargo was safe and you could flee the battle. What was left of your fleet would have no chance of escaping the enemy, but you gave the order anyway. Seconds before you jumped you thanked them for their service for the Emperor."

A huge celebration waited for us. It was time to party like it was the end of the world. We both proceeded to get unimaginably drunk. We kept being pulled in separate directions when people wanted to buy us shots, raising toast to the heroes. I did not know how to handle the attention, so I kept drinking until I could hardly stand up. Tyler got a lap dance, which looked quite ridiculous. An older, quite attractive person was making passes at me. I welcomed the distraction and went for it. We got a little carried away, making out and feeling each other up in the corner of the bar. Suddenly we were interrupted by Tyler, who pulled them off of me and hit them so hard in the face that they fell to the floor. What the fuck! Some marines came and dragged Tyler away, telling me that they would put them in the brig to cool down. Serves them right, I thought.

I ran into them at a party celebrating the miraculous return of the two pilot heroes, Tyler Carrillo and Skye Duran. Fran’s spouse was quite drunk and in a fragile state. I should have stayed with them and kept them company, but I was on my way to a conversation about the Starcaller mission that was being planned.
Later I came back to the party, just in time to see a disgusting scene. Duran was making out with Fran’s spouse, hands inside their clothes, fondling them in public - clearly taking advantage of their inebriated, vulnerable state. Carrillo was there too, pulling Fran’s spouse from the back of their shirt in a violent manner. I ran to the nearest marines and, taking my most authoritative voice, ordered them to go and stop this. They did, just in time when Carrillo hit Fran’s spouse in the face so hard that they fell to the ground. The marines took Duran and Carrillo away, hopefully to the brig. I went to help Fran’s spouse, taking them to sick bay. I should have stayed."
