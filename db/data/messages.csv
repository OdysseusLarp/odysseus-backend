I messed up. Big time. Sorry for not being there when you needed me, especially during Delta's passing. I see now how I let you down, and I regret it deeply. My expectations got in the way, and I didn't give you the support you deserved.
I'm sorry for being disappointed when you chose your own path instead of following mine. I realize now that was selfish of me. And I'm sorry for our recent argument. I've made mistakes, and I'm feeling the weight of them now.
No matter what, you're my son, and I love you. I wish I could go back and be a better dad to you. But I can't. All I can do is hope you find happiness in your own way.
I hope you can forgive me. I'm trying to make things right, even if it's late. Take care of yourself.

Time to spill some truth. You're my daughter, a beautiful result of a fleeting affair with Qwen Montoya. Sorry for keeping it under wraps for so long. Life's been complicated, and I made some misguided choices.
You've grown into an amazing person, Jill. Your strength and determination are inspiring. From military training to promotions, you've shown what you're made of. I'm proud of you, and I see great potential for you to rise even higher, maybe even become a Star Captain.
I'm here for you, Jill, ready to support you no matter what. Family is important, and I want to strengthen our bond.
Oh, and here's a bombshell: Amir Bolton is your sibling. Crazy, right?
Love,
Mark Bolton

There's something I need to tell you, something I've kept hidden for far too long. You have a sibling named Remi Sharp, born before you, whom I left behind when I changed my name from Lydia Sharp to Li and ran from danger. I had to leave Remi behind, believing, perhaps naively, that they would be safer in Pax's care than with me. I was afraid of what Pax might do if I took Remi with me, afraid of the reprisals, the threats, the violence that might follow. This decision haunts me, but I thought it was for the best. Remi is on board the ESS Odysseus, and I hope you could be there for them.

I'm so glad that you are alive. I had to run, run away from Pax. I couldn't take you with me so I left you behind, changed my name and fled. I knew you would be safer in Pax's care than with me.

20,Amira is alive,Elya Andrews,Caden Andrews,55,,Text NPC,15,FALSE,Not yet,"Dear Caden,
There's something important I need to share with you. Your daughter Amira is alive. Against all odds, she survived the attack on Ellarion, thanks to the bravery and quick thinking of Aydan.
When the Machines descended upon Ellarion, chaos ensued. Aydan managed to shield Amira from harm and lead her to a refuge where Amira was picked up on a transporter. There weren't enough room so Aydan was left behind to take the next transporter which never came. It's a miracle, Caden. Despite the darkness Amira is safe now, and we owe it all to Aydan's heroism.
Amira was injured during the attack and therefore I only got information about it just a while ago.  She is on board ESS Aries.
I know this news may bring both relief and a flood of emotions. Please know that Amira is in good hands, and I will do everything in my power to ensure her well-being. Let us find solace in the knowledge that our beloved Amira is alive and safe.
