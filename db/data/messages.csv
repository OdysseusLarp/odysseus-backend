I messed up. Big time. Sorry for not being there when you needed me, especially during Delta's passing. I see now how I let you down, and I regret it deeply. My expectations got in the way, and I didn't give you the support you deserved.
I'm sorry for being disappointed when you chose your own path instead of following mine. I realize now that was selfish of me. And I'm sorry for our recent argument. I've made mistakes, and I'm feeling the weight of them now.
No matter what, you're my son, and I love you. I wish I could go back and be a better dad to you. But I can't. All I can do is hope you find happiness in your own way.
I hope you can forgive me. I'm trying to make things right, even if it's late. Take care of yourself.

There's something I need to tell you, something I've kept hidden for far too long.

I had to leave Remi behind, believing, perhaps naively, that they would be safer in Pax's care than with me. I was afraid of what Pax might do if I took Remi with me, afraid of the reprisals, the threats, the violence that might follow. This decision haunts me, but I thought it was for the best.

21,Amira is alive,Elya Andrews,Caden Andrews,55,,Fleet Admiral,11,FALSE,Not yet,"Dear Caden,
There's something important I need to share with you. Your daughter Amira is alive. Against all odds, she survived the attack on Ellarion, thanks to the bravery and quick thinking of Aydan.
When the Machines descended upon Ellarion, chaos ensued. Aydan managed to shield Amira from harm and lead her to a refuge where Amira was picked up on a transporter. There weren't enough room so Aydan was left behind to take the next transporter which never came. It's a miracle, Caden. Despite the darkness Amira is safe now, and we owe it all to Aydan's heroism.
Amira was injured during the attack and therefore I only got information about it just a while ago. She is on board ESS Aries.
I know this news may bring both relief and a flood of emotions. Please know that Amira is in good hands, and I will do everything in my power to ensure her well-being. Let us find solace in the knowledge that our beloved Amira is alive and safe.
