Level 1: Closed fracture. Stress fractures requires only rest and immobilization.

Level 2: Incomplete fracture. This term means that the bone is cracked, but it isn't separated into two parts. Needs splint, rest and immobilization.

Level 3: Displaced fracture. In this type of fracture, the bone fragments on each side of the break are not aligned. A displaced fracture may require surgery to realign the bones properly. This is a serious condition that requires immediate, aggressive treatment to decrease the chance of an infection. Needs antibitoics, splint, rest and immobilization."
