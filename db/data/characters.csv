Your mother left you when you were just a baby. Despite the hard circumstances you loved working with your father in their engineering workshop. Your fascination with androids and Machines began during your teenage years, leading you to explore the intersection of technology, ethics, and morality. The friendship with Lane Thomas boosted your fascination with engineering even more. 
After the military training you found one more target for your interest: spaceships and in no time you were on board OSS Burro as an assistant engineer and later on on board ESS Odysseus. You understand Odysseus “Cherry”, as the Chief Engineer Amir Bolton calls the Odysseus, better than most of the humans on board.
You are quite shy especially when it comes to romantic relationships but there are few people who have been able to break the ice and become close friends like Lane. The other one is Ziva, an android onboard the ESS Odysseus. You admire their efficiency and adaptability. You are concerned about the possibility of Ziva being mistreated due to their status as an android, and you have vowed to take action if you witnessed any signs of discrimination.
On a romantic side you have a total crush on beta marine Gene Hawkins and at least according to Torrey, your fellow engineer, they have a crush on you too or why else would they ask you to come and fix stuff near them? So far you have been too shy to really take any actions but you have been building the courage to do it.
The accidental interaction with an alien artifact in the Science lab two days ago led you and Nikita, a fellow engineer, to steal the artifact so you could study it more. You determined it has potential to enhance the ship but you still need more information. So far no-one has noticed the artifact is missing.

You are justifiably confident in your own abilities and ethics, and devoted to mentoring and developing the potential of those around you.
You have been raised by your grandmother since your parent’s died in a fire when you were just an infant. You were too young to remember them, but your grandmother Hilde (NPC) has told you a lot about them and as a teenager you stumbled on an old news article about suspicions that the fire may not have been an accident, but the investigations were halted and forgotten. Hilde told you that there were some suspicions but nothing concrete was ever found and the past is best to be left in the past. It still sometimes bothers you. 
Two most important people in your life growing up were your grandmother Hilde and your mothers sibling Jaden Hill (NPC). Jaden has been a huge inspiration for you growing up and almost like an older sibling to you. They have gotten far in life and are nowadays part of Purity’s inner circle and you are so proud of them. Jaden’s opinions are quite a bit more conservative than yours and sometimes you disagree because of it, but you still love them dearly. 
While you were working at Ellarion City Academic Hospital, your brilliant but overconfident colleague Aeran Lester insisted on operating on their own child. The difficult operation failed and the child died. Aeran lost their ability to work and the last time you spoke to them, they drunkenly blamed you for not stopping them.
One of your most talented students was Gail Wells. They lacked confidence but were quick learner and hard worker, even working to save people during the terrorist attack on the University, in which they had lost friends. You were surprised when they suddenly left without explanation before they graduated.
After some years you felt you were no longer learning and developing yourself, so you joined the ESS Odysseus as Chief Medic. Gail is now working under you again.
When the Odysseus picked up survivors, they included your old academy friend Eva Ellis and also Aeran Lester. You’re recruiting all possible help into medbay to cope with the emergency.
During the latest mission you have spent some time with marine Gale Chapman, you are close friends with Gale’s mother Beth (NPC) and have found a lot of joy from talking with Gale too. Unfortunately you recently found out that Gale and their team leader Nolan Hunter might be having a romantic relationship which is against the rules. You didn’t have any other option so you sent a message to Gale’s mother Beth in hopes that she could talk with her child. But now it might be your responsibility to talk with Gale about the situation. 
Gale isn’t the only marine who has problems, you recently found out that Beta Marine Gene Hawkins is sick and their condition will only get worse, you have encouraged Gene to come forward about their condition, but you are not sure if they have.

Jin is furious and even with everything that has happened since, finding justice for Richard is still Jin’s priority. Despite Jin thinking so, they are not alone in this: Richard’s family (Eva, Harper, Fenix, Deron) will also help. They can do their own investigations and pressure Police officer Valerian Fukui to work on the case. 
Dr. Aeran Lester saved Jin’s life and Jin is ever thankful for them
Jin’s dear family member Jose Cain has been kidnapped. Jin wants to know what happened to them and bring the perpetrators to justice. Also their Dynasty Hope needs a new leader.
As a senator, Jin will have a central role in establishing the new civilian government, and ending martial law. Jin wants to remain a senator, and maybe even become a new prime minister. Jin wants to be in control and has high confidence in their own abilities (sometimes to the point of being arrogant). Jin also wants the civil justice system working again so Richard’s murderers and Jose’s kidnappers can be prosecuted.
Jin has high confidence and trust for their assistant Harper Ellis, whom Jin has been encouraging to pursue a career of their own (with Jin’s help of course).
Jin is planning to tell Fran Abrankowich that Skye Duran took advantage of Fran's spouse Gabe Abrankowich (NPC) and Tyler Carrillo hit them.

Yera’s relationship with Evin Reid fell apart after their child Haven (NPC) died. Yera thinks Evin is irresponsible for letting their common project, a machine-made android Devyn Pearson walk free among humans - and now Pearson has murdered their spouse! Even though the project is classified, Yera hopes to find someone high-ranking enough with some security clearances, Vice Admiral or Admiral, so that they could tell that Pearson isn’t human. Yera hopes that Evin’s later project Ziva doesn’t come with any surprises. And what has Evin been working on the previous years?!
Yera is a scholar of androids, artificial intelligence and artificial memories. Their expertise will be needed once more and more people understand what it means that androids can look like humans. They can also participate in the other science related tasks during the game even if they don’t directly touch Yera’s areas of expertise.

Are Kai’s shady businesses with Lonnie Gordon over, or is some pragmatic play still necessary to make sure that humanity is in the right hands?
Who murdered Richard Tremor? Is Purity still pulling strings in the background? Kai can work with senator Jin Komatsu and police officer Valerian Fukui in this. To achieve justice, does Kai need to come clean on the election fraud? 
Kai is one of those adamant to see law being abided even in the times of war, sharing their values with at least Valerian, Ballard Case, Fenix Ellis and Caden Andrews, who will also work for this goal. 
Kai is very suspicious about what happened on Starcaller. Is it possible that both the emergency transmitter and the engines really broke down by accident? Or do the soldiers have a secret mission? And what on earth is going on with Dallan Jordan?
When Kai was on Velian, Aedan and Jaeco were their friends in need. Kai can help them find their place now, and mediate between Velian and EOC leaders.

During the game, she will meet her grandchild Eugenie again.
Gaylen's decision to follow her orders and bring the machine-made android back to the EOC, no matter the cost, still haunts her. Was the android really worth all those lives? What did the scientist Evin Reid even do with it?
Gaylen still remembers interrogating pilot Dallan Jordan who was captured by the Machines 20 years ago, held for a while and then released with the message that the war was over. Gaylen was left with the feeling that something was not right, and that feeling has never left her.
Gaylen is appointed to the War Council, and has been asked to work as an XO in the solar shift. She feels very reluctant about both positions but will have to do her duty anyway.
The Old Ways religion has become important to Gaylen. She has found solace from the faith especially in recent years. It was Gaylen who rescued the Genesis era relic ‘Keys to the Paradise’ from the temple during the attack. Gaylen just can’t shake the feeling that it could very well be the literal key to your survival and really help humankind find a way to the home of their ancestors. Gaylen gave the relic to the Old Ways priestess Osha Green.  
Gaylen's war veteran friends Xavier Blake, Roan Rowen and Cal Allen were once closer to her than her own family. After the war she lost touch with them, or pulled away to be exact, but she can count on them still.
Gaylen is skilled in engineering and after being rescued from the planet has been helping out the engineers. Now Gaylen has been appointed as XO to solar shift, which is way out of her comfort zone. (Note: Gaylen’s optional uniform is engineer even though their assigned role is XO. Gaylen has refused to wear an officer uniform as it would make it too official for her. She would rather just help to fix things than take part in commanding. During the game Gaylen can help out engineers during their free time.)

Your mother died unexpectedly and your father developed depression, so Isha had to take care of the family. You had a love for engineering and at the age of 16, you were the youngest mechanical engineering student or professional ever to gain the Imperial Science Award. 
However, you did not want the attention but wanted to be left alone and finally you just snapped. Without telling anyone you left Ellarion and ended up on Osiris, where you began a new life as Lane Thomas and became best friends with your neighbor, Vane Hodge, until they left for studies elsewhere. You would really like to get in touch with Vane and revive your friendship, if possible.
You adopted an unwanted baby you found in a crashed spaceship, named them Shae and raised them as your own child. Later you found out a child of the Emperor had been kidnapped and was never found. Shae had the peculiar blueish, almost black blood of the Imperial line, but you never contacted the authorities. After leading a very sheltered and isolated life, Shae ran away around a year and a half ago. You wonder where they are, if they are alive, and will they ever forgive you.
When you heard Shae might be on the space station Atlantis 3, you applied for a job there. To get the paperwork done, you paid the Zodiac Web for help. Later you realized your papers and passage to Atlantis had caused someone to die and feel bad about it. 
On Atlantis, you have made friends with the XO, Tristan Fukui. You know you have made mistakes, but they have helped you to understand yourself and that it is important that you strive to become a better person.
About a year ago, a Velian called Saria came to Atlantis looking for help with their research regarding the Dome the Velians lived in. You ended up using all your free time helping Saria and found happiness in mechanics once again. How did you ever let yourself forget that you love engineering, mechanics, machines and figuring things out? 
A Velian group and a group from EOC, led by Admiral Blake, was coming to Atlantis, but for some reason Blake’s ship the ESS Icarus shot Atlantis while trying to dock.  They say it was due to malfunctions, but you don’t believe any of it. Neither did Zyra Lee. Soon after their arrival, the Machines came. 
You were able to jump away on Blake’s ship and the Machine fleet did not follow you. However, when you got to Velian you were too late: the Dome had collapsed and only a few survivors were left on an ancient spaceship; a Genesis ship. Why was this one here? Did it still work?

Your mother died unexpectedly and your father developed depression, so Isha had to take care of the family. You had a love for engineering and at the age of 16, you were the youngest mechanical engineering student or professional ever to gain the Imperial Science Award. 
However, you did not want the attention but wanted to be left alone and finally you just snapped. Without telling anyone you left Ellarion and ended up on Osiris, where you began a new life as Lane Thomas and became best friends with your neighbor, Vane Hodge, until they left for studies elsewhere. You would really like to get in touch with Vane and revive your friendship, if possible.
You adopted an unwanted baby you found in a crashed spaceship, named them Shae and raised them as your own child. Later you found out a child of the Emperor had been kidnapped and was never found. Shae had the peculiar blueish, almost black blood of the Imperial line, but you never contacted the authorities. After leading a very sheltered and isolated life, Shae ran away around a year and a half ago. You wonder where they are, if they are alive, and will they ever forgive you.
When you heard Shae might be on the space station Atlantis 3, you applied for a job there. To get the paperwork done, you paid the Zodiac Web for help. Later you realized your papers and passage to Atlantis had caused someone to die and feel bad about it. 
On Atlantis, you have made friends with the XO, Tristan Fukui. You know you have made mistakes, but they have helped you to understand yourself and that it is important that you strive to become a better person.
About a year ago, a Velian called Saria came to Atlantis looking for help with their research regarding the Dome the Velians lived in. You ended up using all your free time helping Saria and found happiness in mechanics once again. How did you ever let yourself forget that you love engineering, mechanics, machines and figuring things out? 
A Velian group and a group from EOC, led by Admiral Blake, was coming to Atlantis, but for some reason Blake’s ship the ESS Icarus shot Atlantis while trying to dock.  They say it was due to malfunctions, but you don’t believe any of it. Neither did Zyra Lee. Soon after their arrival, the Machines came. 
You were able to jump away on Blake’s ship and the Machine fleet did not follow you. However, when you got to Velian you were too late: the Dome had collapsed and only a few survivors were left on an ancient spaceship; a Genesis ship. Why was this one here? Did it still work? Your fingers were itching to try the technology you could see was still in place.

Jodey is on the brink of a breakthrough with their research into an AVK-012 infused altered araknium bomb.

Jodey is content with their marriage to Leigh Kent. It is a marriage of convenience. Jodey cares about Leigh and feels guilty for forgetting about Leigh when it was necessary to save the research project.
Jodey's friend Devyn Pearson is suspected of murdering their spouse Ryane Pearson (NPC). Jodey doesn't think it makes any sense and is sure that Devyn is innocent. Even if it turns out to be true, Jodey is sure there is something more to this story. Devyn can be cold and insufferably but they are not cold blood murderer.  
Jodey has another very different kind of friend Briana Chambers, Briana is one of the very few people who can convince Jodey to leave their work for a short while and be social. 
There is one scientist in Remy Hall’s science team who might actually be worth to ask to help them to finish their research - Blake Ishimoto.

While your mother was a strict Acolyte of the Old Ways, your father was a compassionate member of Mercy Dynasty and later became a Senator in the Yellow Party, advocating for equality and opposing dynasties and class society. Despite their expectations, at 16, you chose a different path by joining the military for discipline and order, eventually defying your parents' wishes to pursue a career in engineering, driven by a desire to forge your own destiny.
After earning a traineeship on the military vessel ESS Horizon, you fell in love with the Star Captain, Roan Rowen, despite the challenges of a forbidden relationship. You planned on leaving the military and becoming a civilian engineer to be openly together but your world shattered when it was the XO who escorted you out of the ship and not Roan.
You found a sense of contentment when you met and eventually married Torrey, despite Torrey’s memory wipe procedure done to them 10 years ago. Later, as engineers on the ESS Odysseus, you and Torrey embraced a polyamorous relationship with Weapons Officer Mel McBride, discovering a newfound sense of home and happiness together.
While assisting Vane with repairs, a mishap occurred when Vane cut their hand, staining an alien artifact. Recognizing a strange reaction, you carefully concealed the artifact in your tool bag, recognizing the need for further investigation. The incident left you both intrigued and cautious.
Your friend Nickie has been increasingly using stimulants possibly due to their complicated relationship. Nickie remains silent, and you're being troubled by their well-being so much that you sabotaged their fighter to stop them from risking their life by flying under stimulants.

You entered the military academy, to the disappointment of your parents, where you met and learned to trust friends from other dynasties, fell in love with your spouse Aran (NPC), and drifted away from the Purity dynasty.
After six happy years and a child together, Aran died, leaving you heartbroken.  You left baby Ismy with your sister Amy (NPC) and joined a military ship.
You went back to the Purity Dynasty, welcomed by your old friend Yuri Mills, who unlike you has always had a very public role in the dynasty and may not be as well informed with some of the secrets within your dynasty.  
You on the other hand ended up becoming a part of those bigger secrets. While it wasn’t explicitly explained to you, you did put pieces together regarding Purity’s secret deal with the machines. You haven’t told anyone as you are quite accountable for your part in it. 
Your assignment for the latest mission was to make yourself useful and liked, to report everything of interest that is going on to Purity, follow the science lab and to monitor all that scientist Devyn Pearson does.
While you don’t know details for the big plan, you know enough to realize that Purity’s plans have clearly gone horribly wrong.  Since Odysseus turned back for the survivors, you have been wrestling with your loyalties. Should you keep working for Purity or betray them to save humanity?  Will Ismy ever forgive you?
You have two close friends onboard, the android Ziva Callahan and machine war veteran Malak Fukui, however either one of them knows the truth about you and fear of losing them keeps you silent. 
The one person who most likely knows what the fuck is going on in Purity is Dallan Jordan, who you are just about to rescue from Starcaller. You need to find a way to talk with them as soon as possible. 
You are ambitious, you love the idea of being in control and you always crave for something more. You know how to talk to people and you could be described as a master manipulator as well. You want security and respect and your dynasty has done well on giving you those. Your greatest fear is to lose it all, to lose the power and security you have. But if it ever came to it, you would turn your back on your dynasty – saving yourself has been your priority. Always.

Briana still mourns them. Their betrothed, Han Barnes, remained in Briana's life even after losing Karin. After all these years Briana will be reunited with Karin and has a chance to learn what happened.
As psychiatrist Briana was involved in an experiment where the memories of a murderer were wiped, to see if they would be able to live without crime. Brianna was shocked to encounter this murdered under their new identity, Torrey Watson, working on Odysseus. Briana would like to discreetly interview Torrey to see how the experiment has worked.
Briana can't believe that their patient Devyn Pearson really murdered their spouse. Is it really true? If yes, how come Briana really couldn't see it coming?
Briana had a relationship with Oriel Cook when they were both teenagers. Briana got accidentally pregnant and was forced to terminate the pregnancy by their parents and separated from Oriel into a strict boarding school.
Years later Briana reconnects with Oriel and all the feelings are still there, Briana is confident that the feelings are mutual. But neither of them have acted upon it because they are both married with other people and Briana is expecting a child with her husband Lucas Wilson (NPC). However Briana’s husband died in the attacks, sacrificing himself to save Briana and the baby. But Oriel’s spouse Zeya Cook is still very much alive and in fact the captain of the ship they were rescued at.
Briana has two close but very different friends, Jodey Agaki is a scientist and a bit of a work-a-holic, who needs Briana to have something else than work in their life. And Osha Green is a priestess of the Old Ways and actually in a very similar situation to Briana, also being pregnant with complicated feelings, but these are only rumors as Osha hasn't yet opened up to Briana about any of this!  
Briana has offered her services as a medic in the medbay to have something meaningful to do, but they are open to continue in their actual profession as a psychiatrist as well: there happen to be several of her patients aboard Odysseus.
Briana is ~4 months pregnant.

But Alia being an identical twin to Aydan also creates an abundance of complicated feelings. 
Caden has decided to hold on to being needed, hold on to justice. They are determined to help their friends both in re-establishing the civilian government and in law enforcement. These friends include police officer Valerian Fukui as well as others with similar goals. 
Accidentally driving over a pedestrian 15 years ago still haunts Caden. Justice was not served as Caden’s mother pulled some strings  and Caden still feels guilty and like a fraud because of it. Now Leone Mills, the child of their victim, is on Odysseus. Caden is looking for a way to finally clear their conscience.
This incident also forced Caden to push their close friend Leigh Kent away, something they still regret.

You are now living in denial, in an alternate reality “dream world”. You are addicted to stims, pills or whatever drugs you can find just to keep you believing this was all just a dream.
You were a possible Dynasty heir of the Wisdom Dynasty but the family disowned you after a fatal car accident where Kit Hobbs (NPC) was killed.
You ended up as an  operative in the Zodiac Web, a criminal organization, and you hold proof (or you had them, hid them and forgot where you hid them… drugs might have had something to do with that… the papers are  somewhere on ESS Odysseus you are sure of that) that Lonnie Gordon, the second-in-command of the mission, was planning on betraying Pax Hougton, your boss, in the organization.
Your latest job for the Zodiac Web was to help kidnap a high profile Hope Dynasty heir Jose Cain. The situation is currently under control as long as you keep your mouth shut and pretend to be civilians who “rescued' Jose.
You are falling in love with the Zodiac Web doctor Aeran Lester.
You have friends you can rely on like Remy Sharp and Hedly Walker.
Life in the Zodiac Web would be pretty okay if it wasn’t for Shae Thomas who you can’t stand. 
Aeran recruited or more like dragged you to help out in the medbay since you do have some study years in med school. All the help is needed and Aeran clearly hopes this would help you with your shock since you refused to take medication for it. At least now you get access to some drugs and can blackmail more potent ones from Gail Wells, another medic.
You need to find a buyer for a valuable rhodium necklace, Silent Petal, you and Shae Thomas stole a while ago. The necklace is currently in your possession and it seems to soothe you and you don’t want to hand it over. You want to keep it for yourself.

You disagree with many of your Dynasty's policies and the opinions of your leaders. 
You finally decided to do something about it and not just be a bystander and you used your skills as a hacker to divert Purity's wealth to numerous charities, an act that most definitely will not go unpunished if you ever get caught by those in power in your Dynasty.
In the aftermath of the Machine attack you assumed a false identity as artist Ator Davis and ended up forming a strange partnership with your one night stand who now pretends to be ‘your spouse’ Jona Davis, you have no idea of their true identity but you have started to develop very real feelings towards them.
While maintaining your false identity you have done your best to offer support and comfort to grieving survivors like Caden Andrews and Jonah Malone, it makes you feel better for the situation to be able to just be there for those who have lost everything.
While you do not miss the majority of your dynasty there are some you still care about deeply. Young pop star Ismy Arima is like a little sibling to you but they idolize your Dynasty and unlikely would understand your actions. You are still happy they are alive.  
Another close friend Jose Cain is from another dynasty and also amongst the survivors. You might yet both need each other's help.

After mother Sahara Novak (NPC) died in a car accident fifteen years ago. Your  father took you to his care but started to train you to become an assassin and spy for your dynasty.
Few of your assignments have stayed with you more than others. As a teenager you poisoned Aran Arima (NPC), Ismy Arima’s mother, and killed Misha Kent (NPC), Leigh Kent’s father. 
Especially slowly poisoning Aran so that it looked like they just got sick while at the same time spending time and taking care of little Ismy was heartbreaking. You became very close with Ismy. And you still hate yourself for what you did. But you were just a child yourself, afraid of your father and your dynasty. Or so you keep telling yourself.  
You eventually escaped that life by enlisting in the army and making a contract with them that you would spend your entire life in service. Your father and Purity were furious but even their influence had limits. 
You have told outlines of your past to your team leader Nolan Hunter, but not of course the fact that you have killed people at the orders of your dynasty. Those are crimes that would put you in jail and you can never tell anyone about them.   
You are in a relationship with Lee Savage from Beta team, you love them but it feels like the relationship isn’t going anywhere.

Leigh will be part of the political play, trying to establish a new civilian government. Leigh just missed a senator position in the latest elections, but was the first in line should any Yellow party member cancel their position. Could they just step forward now that most of the senators are surely dead? A senator post would have been rightfully Leigh's anyway if the rumors are true that the election was rigged.
Leigh is supposed to be a connecting character between the Velians and EOC politicians, and also a supporter of preserving the Velian culture.
When being very young, Leigh committed to being a pacifist, looking for peace. What can they do to take steps towards peace now?
11 years ago, Leigh lost their father Misha Kent (NPC) - their hero and the person in whose footsteps they followed in their political career. Leigh believes that their father’s murder may have had political connotations. Do they hold enough power to look into the case once more? And if not - who does?
Jill Montoya was the love of Leigh's life, the one that got away. It's been so good to see them again. Could something come out of it?
Leigh has been in a relationship with their spouse Jodey Agaki for seven years, but Leigh isn't in love, really. Are they going to stay together just out of habit?
Caden Andrews was one of Leigh's most important friends until Caden cut Leigh off. After all these years Leigh is still hurt and would like to know what happened.
Can Leigh and Yuri Mills become friends again and find a way to work together?

Beva has suffered a lot for their lower status and after their betrothed Harper Ellis broke up with them because of that, you did something you shouldn’t have. You used your family’s name to pull some strings and got Beva assigned to Odysseus. Beva doesn’t know and would probably be pissed at you if they found out. 
You had always taken your privilege for granted and not really thought about your wealth or status, but maybe it has always at least subconsciously bothered you and some time ago you realized that your family’s success had always come at the cost of others’ suffering, so you made a vow to be the kind of leader who would not leave anyone behind, no matter what.
You are the leader of the Beta team and feel responsible for all of them.  On a recent mission there were some injuries and the incident was never properly discussed. You need to make sure mistakes like that don’t happen again.
One of your team members, Gene Hawkins, told you some time ago that they are ill and after some time they can’t work as a marine anymore. A bit later another team member Lee Savage told you that they had a dream that there was a plant on some distant planet that could cure Gene. Lee’s dreams do have a tendency to have some truth in them, but you still think this is a wild goose chase that could put your team at risk. So you are not overly enthusiastic about it. There is a difference between not leaving anyone behind and chasing a fairy tale. 
Security Chief Fran Abrankowich has been very supportive of you and you really appreciate their guidance and advice.

Date: 531.137

Suspect Name: Gene Hawkins

Case Reference: Misha Kent Murder Case

Incident Summary:
On 531.137, while visiting the city of Ellarion, the suspect, [Your Name], witnessed a brutal murder. The victim, identified as Senator Misha Kent, was fatally stabbed. The suspect reported seeing the assailant but could only describe a distinctive X-shaped scar between the shoulder and collarbone of the perpetrator, who wore a black tank top under a black hoodie.

Arrest Details:
Due to being the only other person at the crime scene, the suspect was detained by local authorities on charges of suspicion of murder. Given the high-profile nature of the victim, immediate and intense scrutiny was applied to the case.

Custody and Treatment:
The suspect endured severe interrogation tactics, including threats, humiliation, and physical violence, aimed at extracting a confession. The police emphasized the suspect's lack of social standing, reminding them of their low status as a resident of Osiris, an area noted for its marginalized community.

Outcome:
After an extensive period of detention and interrogation, it became evident that there was no substantial evidence linking the suspect to the crime. Despite the extreme measures taken during interrogation, the suspect maintained their innocence and did not confess to the murder. Eventually, due to insufficient evidence, the suspect was released from custody.

Remarks:
The suspect's experience during detention was profoundly distressing, leaving lasting psychological scars. The real perpetrator, marked by the unique scar, remains at large, and the case of Senator Misha Kent's murder is still open.

You walked among them, listened to their troubles and guided them, gave them advice, and loved them.
You are the only one left of an ancient race who created Them, creatures of your image that the humans now call the Machines. As the last of your kind, your task was to destroy the Machines, but you could not destroy something you had given life to. Instead you turned them off and gathered them and their Lifegiver, the AI that called itself Nest, to one of your last ships and sealed them inside. There they would sleep for all eternity in the emptiness of space, but they found a way to free themselves. 
39 years ago Velian was found by humans from EOC. They told the Velians about the Machine Attacks. You are the only one who knows the origin of the Machines, although you do not know where they reside nowadays. You kept your veil on around the humans, as you had indeed made the Machines in your image. Who you really were became a nationwide secret. The anthropologists sent from EOC to study Velian culture started to think you were a spiritual leader chosen from among the One Percent. You let them believe that.
After the collapse of the Dome, which some researchers had already predicted a decade ago, the surviving Velians look to you with hope and for guidance. 
You have no idea how your lives will change after this. But one thing is sure, you would do anything to save these humans.  
You have found a new purpose with guiding and sheltering the Velians, but you have always been adamant that they make their own decisions, and even now this stands. These humans need to find their own path, it can not be laid out for them. But now it might be time for them to learn the truth about their enemy and the history these Machines share with you. But still you hesitate.

Gaylen Russell's friend from the last machine wars.
Malak served with Bolton on the ESS Harbinger 20 years ago in his first post-marine posting. As commander/more senior officer Bolton helped the experienced marine transition to the naval officer role.
Mark, Amir Bolton's father and Vice Admiral, Star Captain of the ESS Harbinger, wanted Amir to follow in his footsteps and become a Star Captain but when he found out Amir had quit your Marine training to be an Engineer, he cut all communications with Amir. Amir's mother, Liz, tried to reason with him but in the end it only caused Amir's parents to file for divorce. Amir is still unsure whether they should try to write to their father one more letter. Mark did seem to be more receptive after Amie’s funeral.
Mark Bolton is the real father of Jill Montoya. Mark Bolton had a short affair with Qwen Montoya and result was Jill Montoya. Mark knew but didn't want to break his marriage for Qwen and Jill. Qwen found some scavenger man to be with (and they pretend to be the other parent for Jill). After few baby years Qwen and the scavanger man pretty much left Jill to survive alone. Life was too hard for them. From the shadows Mark (with the help of Lera Yang) helped Jill to survive and got a spot from military for Jill. Mark made sure that Jill was getting the military engineering training, a transfer to Ellarion City Military Academy. 
Mark was supprised when Leigh Kent (a young Purity politician) pulled some strings so that Jill could be hired on ESS Odysseus but Jill didn't accept the job that someone else had ""given"" them. Jill got an internship on OSS Taurus and pretty soon was promoted to ESS Bluecoat. Mark was proud of Jill and how relentlessly they fought their way in the society. Unlike Amir who had all within their grasp and they didn't want to pursue to be a Star Captain (as was their dream as a child). Amir would have made a great Captain and now Amir would never rise to their fathers level. After Jill's promotions it was easier for Mark to pull some strings behind the scenes and get Jill a promotion to ESS Odysseus under their other child Amir Bolton. At least they both were now in the same place and easier to keep an eye on them. Jill definitely had more ambitions and with a right push... maybe Jill could be the next Star Captain of the family?",Mark should reveal (mesasge ready written) that they are the father of Jill Montoya.

Caleb often came home beaten up by the police, and sometimes didn’t come at all because they had been arrested. About a year ago, Caleb was suspended from the military for a few months because of their repeat offenses in their private time.
Recently Caleb was very excited because they had been selected for a mission to the Atlantis space station, together with their roommate Malak Kovalenko, where Caleb would have a chance to meet some Velians face-to-face. However, that dream was ruined as someone who Caleb has been dating recently, another marine Zyra Lee, heard about the trip and managed to pull some strings so that Caleb was left out of the mission and Zyra got in instead. Caleb was furious.

Reese is on the autism spectrum. She struggles with strangers, eye contact and physical touch. Writing is easier for her than talking.
Tyler has always been Reese’s closest family member. Tyler understood her the best and was patient and ready to connect with Reese on Reese’s own terms. Reese spent the most time with her nanny, but Tyler came in as a close second. Tyler and Reese’s parents were nice enough, but they were very busy with work and struggled to connect with Reese.
Reese has just suffered the most terrible week of her life. Trying to flee from the Machine attacks, the famly was hit by a bomb on the street and only Reese, who was rounding a corner, survived. Luckily she didn’t see her parents being blown up (they had already walked around the corner), but she did see her nanny die and stayed next to their body until some marines found her and rescued her. She hasn’t seen anyone she knows after that. 
After the attacks, Reese received some messages from Tyler asking if she was ok. Reese had heard that Tyler was alive, but she only received the messages after Tyler had already left on the suicide mission with Skye. Reese was devastated and terrified about being abandoned. When it turned out that Tyler survived the mission, Reese was relieved but also terribly angry for Tyler not thinking about her. 
Three days ago, Reese heard that Tyler has left again on the Starcaller mission to help to negotiate with the Machines. Reese is very, very hurt that Tyler has left her again. 
Reese is physically fine but mentally in a very bad position. She can’t bear to lose Tyler and is terrified that she will be left all alone.

Richard was an advocate of a more moderate Purity and he headed a moreate wing of the Purple Party that sparked talk of splitting off and joining a different party and dynasty.
Lonnie Gordon and Kai Rogers helped Richard to win a place as senator by tampering the votes.
Several months before the elections, the Purple party was in a volatile position because the previous party leader had announced that they were not going to run again, and would quit the senate after these elections. There was a power vacuum in the party, and both our moderate wing and the radical wing were desperate to fill it: whoever became the new party leader would have a huge impact on the direction the party would take in the next few years. After months of campaigning and negotiating, two candidates, senators Richard Tremor (NPC) from the moderate end of the party and Yuri Mills from the radical one, were running neck and neck and neither side wanted to give in to the other. Finally, three months ago, the party decided that it would not be a good look if we can’t even choose a leader. We finally came to the agreement that whomever, Tremor or Mills, would get more votes in the elections would get the party leader position. It might even benefit our party if the voters felt they could participate in a battle of two great leaders.
Both wings were polling the votes regularly, and we in the moderate wing did not like how the situation was developing. We heard that behind the scenes the radical wing was running a smear campaign on Tremor, spreading rumors and blatant lies about him. And that was probably only the tip of the iceberg as they were surely using all means necessary to secure a win. Tremor was popular too: he was a legend, long term senator and a decent human being who wasn’t afraid to stand against Purity, his own Dynasty, when it was necessary. But it looked like Mills would win by a close margin. Mills was the puppet of the most radical members of the party, and Kai was very worried what they would do when grasping the power over the party.
As the elections came closer and it seemed Mills would definitely win over Tremor, we had to act. Gordon recruited a hacker, Kai pulled together the funding, and a small but significant number of final votes were soon registered in support of Tremor instead of Mills. 
So it was done: Tremor secured the party leader positions, and Mills was left as a runner-up.

Hailey saved Alia Swanson's life in a fight on planet Arak by sending Alia to fetch help.
Idris Kalashnik was saved because of Hailey. Haley covered and lured the enemy away from Idris. Hayley told Idris to run.
From Alia Swanson:
You were sent to a planet named Arak where things got a lot worse than expected. The Battle of Arak turned out to be one of the biggest assaults in the Machine Wars. Thousands of soldiers lost their lives there. You were one of the lucky few who survived, thanks to Carroll.
Carroll had observed you closely and given you a talking to, making you confess that you were actually underage. You could tell from their face how heavy it was for them to have to take care of a teenager, like their job wasn’t difficult enough. They had not exposed you, but had still told me that they would try to get you out of Arak as soon as possible.
You were on a mission together when you were ambushed by Machine drones. A battle ensued, and your company fought as hard as you could. But you were vastly outnumbered. You watched your comrades die, left and right. You were absolutely in the wrong place, not trained well enough for this, way too young to hold yourself together, a burden to the team instead of an asset. Carroll saw this and ordered you to run for backup.
You ran. Very soon after you parted from my team, you heard yet another grenade land very close to where you had been. You turned and saw two team members dead on the ground. Just their torsos and hands and heads, you couldn’t see their legs, you think they must have been blown off. You saw Carroll, shouting something to the other side of a pile of rubble. Then Carroll started to run too, alone, away from the pile. The drones followed them and eventually caught up with them. You expected them to kill Carroll but they didn’t, instead they dragged them away, alive. All through this you stood still, frozen in place. You should have done something. You should have run back to help Carroll. You should have run back to your team members to see if they could still be helped. You didn’t see what happened to McBride. After that, another grenade hit the ground very close to you; you felt great pain and passed out.",Hailey was taken by the Machines and will be coming back in a boarding event as a machine,,,,,,Marine,496,496012C789776,Deceased,Caelena,Faith of the High Science,None,Middle,Defiance,Yellow Party,Chief Petty Officer,Career Military,Oren Carroll,Parent,Maisey Carroll ,Parent,Harley Carroll,Sibling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"509 Basic Training at Caelena Military Academy

You saw him last time when you had just announced your pregnancy and Cody was so happy that he was going to be an uncle. 
Briana and Lucas met in the mess hall when Briana was on an internship in the military psychiatric ward. Lucas was nearing the end of their active service and planned to continue in the military as a trainer, a nine to five job. The wedding ceremony was a small and simple affair put together in a hurry, but in all that, exactly as Briana had hoped for. Han Barneds, Osha Green and Jodey Agaki were witnessess. Lucas most likely cannot consieve a child. Lucas took it very hard. It took a long time until Lucas was able to handle the issue and even then would not discuss about adoption or treatment with donated sperm. At some point Briana started to put more effort to make marriage better. Lucas responded well and soon suggested to seek fertility treatment for themselves. The relationship improved after the treatments started, a common objective. You were both happy, the child had been a dream of both of you.
