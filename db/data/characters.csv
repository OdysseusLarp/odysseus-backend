20000,bio1,RJGVTW,FALSE,Mark,Bolton,,"Mark, Amir Bolton's father and Vice Admiral, Star Captain of the ESS Harbinger, wanted Amir to follow in his footsteps and become a Star Captain but when he found out Amir had quit your Marine training to be an Engineer, he cut all communications with Amir. Amir's mother, Liz, tried to reason with him but in the end it only caused Amir's parents to file for divorce. Amir is still unsure whether they should try to write to their father one more letter. Mark did seem to be more receptive after Amie’s funeral.

Mark Bolton is the real father of Jill Montoya. Mark Bolton had a short affair with Qwen Montoya and result was Jill Montoya. Mark knew but didn't want to break his marriage for Qwen and Jill. Qwen found some scavenger man to be with (and they pretend to be the other parent for Jill). After few baby years Qwen and the scavanger man pretty much left Jill to survive alone. Life was too hard for them. From the shadows Mark (with the help of Lera Yang) helped Jill to survive and got a spot from military for Jill. Mark made sure that Jill was getting the military engineering training, a transfer to Ellarion City Military Academy. Mark was supprised when Leigh Kent (a young Purity politician) pulled some strings so that Jill could be hired on ESS Odysseus but Jill didn't accept the job that someone else had ""given"" them. Jill got an internship on OSS Taurus and pretty soon was promoted to ESS Bluecoat. Mark was proud of Jill and how relentlessly they fought their way in the society. Unlike Amir who had all within their grasp and they didn't want to pursue to be a Star Captain (as was their dream as a child). Amir would have made a great Captain and now Amir would never rise to their fathers level. After Jill's promotions it was easier for Mark to pull some strings behind the scenes and get Jill a promotion to ESS Odysseus under their other child Amir Bolton. At least they both were now in the same place and easier to keep an eye on them. Jill definitely had more ambitions and with a right push... maybe Jill could be the next Star Captain of the family?",Mark should reveal (mesasge ready written) that they are the father of Jill Montoya only after he is cast out from ESS Harbinger (mutiny Event).,,,,,,Star Captain,467,467266C483362,Present and accounted for,Caelena,Old Ways,Full citizenship,ESS Harbinger,Middle,Hope,None,Vice Admiral,Career Military,Amir Bolton,Child,Liz Bolton,Spouse,Amie Bolton,Child,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"483 Basic training
