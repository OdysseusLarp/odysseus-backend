Starcaller departed the main fleet three and a half days ago, on star date 152 (of year 542). They had been traveling for two days when suddenly the ship engines broke down.

The military had given the diplomats a tracking device that they could use to find their way back to the main fleet. The device did not work - it didn’t broadcast nor receive any signal. The only remaining option seemed to be to use the ship’s inbuilt emergency transmission. It took 24 hours before anyone responded. It was unexpectedly from the spaceship ESS Odysseus. It took a few further hours for Odysseus to reach Starcaller. Starcaller has just now landed on ESS Odysseus.

There has been speculation about how it can be that a top of the line ship like this can suddenly malfunction, along with the device. Is this sabotage?",,
