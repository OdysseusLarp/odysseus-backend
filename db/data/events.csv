Starcaller departed the main fleet three and a half days ago, on star date 152 (of year 542). They had been traveling for two days when suddenly the ship engines broke down.

The military had given the diplomats a tracking device that they could use to find their way back to the main fleet. The device did not work - it didn’t broadcast nor receive any signal. The only remaining option seemed to be to use the ship’s inbuilt emergency transmission. It took 24 hours before anyone responded. It was unexpectedly from the spaceship ESS Odysseus. It took a few further hours for Odysseus to reach Starcaller. Starcaller has just now landed on ESS Odysseus.

There has been speculation about how it can be that a top of the line ship like this can suddenly malfunction, along with the device. Is this sabotage?",,

Step 1: ESS Harbinger the marshal law is overrun by a mutiny. The mutiny starts at 08:15 and it is induced by Gray Scorpio operatives.
Step 2: The commanders and some of the military personel who were against ending the marshal law are cast out from the ESS Harbinger to a small vessel which is uncapable to jump. 
Step 3: Enemy jumps near the fleet and the fleet jumps towards the target while Odysseus marines are still on an astreroid on Earth outpost mission. Harbinger transporter is left alone flying towards Odysseus messaging franticly to pick them up. Fleet thinks they are liability (machines) and should be left behind.
Step 4: Now Odysseus needs to decide to take them in before the next jump or will they be left behind. Here is a chance that Odysseus will not take them and then all on board the transporter will die. Odysseus can choose to fly towards them and save them before they jump. ","Empty Epsilon: Spawn enemies close to fleet.
Launch Harbiner transport.
Jump fleet away.
Jude Gardner brings the bomb to Hali Okuma if Odysseus decides to save them","
If Odysseus decides to save the ones who were kicked out from Harbinger the NPCs will come onboard. Otherwise they will need to be ""killed"".
Remember to change db after the Harbinger survivors leaves to another ship.
After the NPCs leave from Odysseus to other ships move those to the ships. Li Russell, Thomas Russell and Gira Hayakawa goes to ESS Valkyrie. Others can be randomly selected. Make sure that these 3 will leave before Valkyrie is destroyed!"
